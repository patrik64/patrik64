## Hi

My name is Patrik, a Rust/C++ programmer previously employed by [PSPDFKit](https://www.pspdfkit.com) (now Nutrient) - ([CV](https://github.com/patrik64/patrik64/blob/main/cv.pdf)).

I am a daily user of Rust and Svelte(Kit).

Here are some of my favorite Rust open source projects:

[quadratic](https://github.com/quadratichq/quadratic)  
[zed](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed)  
[graphite](https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite)  
[typst](https://github.com/typst/typst)

I am living in Vienna, Austria and here are my favorite local meetups:

[Svelte Society Austria](https://austria.sveltesociety.dev/)
